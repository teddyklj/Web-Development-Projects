# Web-Development-Projects
This repository contains my web development projects, including clones of popular platforms like Spotify and Airbnb, along with fun interactive games such as the Simon Game. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks, these projects reflect my learning journey and practice in frontend and full-stack development.
